guncontroller
===========

guncontroller hack that enables a custom-built gun controller to be used in a game built in Unity with an Arduino microcontroller.

You will need to run the GunController.ino on an Arduino board for the controller interface and add the Unity files to your project.

Instruction on how to build the physical gun controller can be found here - <insert link>
